## Ships Ahoy!
 A two player game where the players must maneuver their ship
around incoming cannonballs! Each player has 4 lives. If one player dies, the game is over! Each time one of the players reaches the right side of the screen, both players move on to the next level, where the bullets begin to spawn more rapidly. Every time the players reach a new level, more bullects come at a time and the harder the game gets!
